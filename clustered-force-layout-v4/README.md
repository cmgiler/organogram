### Clustered Force Layout using D3 v4

Taken from [pbogden's block](https://bl.ocks.org/pbogden/854425acb57b4e5a4fdf4242c068a127)

Modified from [Mike Bostock's original](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1747543).

Looks more like the version with [custom gravity](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1748247).

Compare with [Shan Carter's v4 adaptation](https://bl.ocks.org/shancarter/f621ac5d93498aa1223d8d20e5d3a0f4).
